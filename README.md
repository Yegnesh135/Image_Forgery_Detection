DL Final Project on Image Forgery Detection using Transfer Learning**

In the digital age, the manipulation and dissemination of visual content have become ubiquitous, giving rise to the critical challenge of ensuring the authenticity and integrity of digital images. The project, "Image Forgery Detection Using Transfer Learning" addresses this pressing concern by presenting an innovative solution that leverages the power of deep learning and advanced image analysis techniques to detect image forgeries.

As the use of image editing tools and the ease of digital content creation continue to expand, the potential for digital image manipulation, alteration, and forgery has never been greater. This poses serious implications for various domains, including journalism, forensics, social media, and e-commerce, where the credibility of visual content is paramount. It is imperative to develop robust and reliable methods for detecting manipulated images to safeguard trust and ensure the integrity of digital visual information.

The proposed project takes a multi-faceted approach to digital image forgery detection, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a cutting-edge deep learning architecture, with Error Level Analysis (ELA), a powerful image analysis technique. By synergizing these methods, the system aims to excel in identifying tampered images, distinguishing between authentic and manipulated content with a high degree of accuracy and robustness.
